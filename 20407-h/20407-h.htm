<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>OLD POPULAR POETRY: "ADAM BELL, CLYM OF
THE CLOUGH, AND WILLIAM OF CLOWDESLY."</h3>

  <p>I have very recently become possessed of a curious printed fragment,
  which is worth notice on several accounts, and will be especially
  interesting to persons who, like myself, are lovers of our early ballad
  poetry. It is part of an unknown edition of the celebrated poem relating
  to the adventures of Adam Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William of
  Cloudesly.</p>

  <p>There are (as many of your readers will be aware from Ritson's small
  volume, <i>Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry</i>, 8vo. 1791) two old
  editions of <i>Adam Bell, &amp;c.</i>, one printed by William Copland,
  without date, and the other by James Roberts in 1605. The edition by
  Copland must have preceded that by Roberts by forty or fifty years, and
  may have come out between 1550 and 1560; the only known copy of it is
  among the Garrick Plays (at least it was so when I saw it) in the British
  Museum. The re-impression by Roberts is not very uncommon, and I think
  that more than one copy of it is at Oxford.</p>

  <p>When Copland printed the poem, he did not enter it at Stationers'
  Hall; comparatively few of his publications, generally of a free,
  romantic, or ludicrous character, were licensed, and he was three times
  fined for not first obtaining the leave of the Company. Nevertheless, we
  do find an entry of a "book" called "Adam Bell," &amp;c., among the
  memoranda belonging to the year 1557-8, but it was made at the instance,
  not of Copland, but of John Kynge, in this form:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"To John Kynge, to prynte this boke called Adam Bell, &amp;c., and for
  his lycense he geveth to the howse"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What sum he gave is not stated. Again, we meet with another notice of
  it in the same registers, under the date of 1581-2, when John Charlwood
  was interested in the undertaking. I mention these two entries
  principally because neither Ritson nor Percy were acquainted with them;
  but they may be seen among the extracts published by the Shakspeare
  Society in 1848 and 1849. <!-- Page 446 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page446"></a>{446}</span></p>

  <p>No impressions by Kynge or Charlwood having come down to us, we have
  no means of knowing whether they availed themselves of the permission
  granted at Stationers' Hall; and, unless I am deceived, the fragment
  which occasions this Note is not from the presses of either of them, and
  is of an earlier date than the time of Copland; the type is much better,
  and less battered, than that of Copland; at the same time it has a more
  antique look, and in several respects, which I am about to point out, it
  furnishes a better text than that given by Ritson from Copland's edition,
  or by Percy with the aid of his folio manuscript. I am sorry to say that
  it only consists of a single sheet; but this is nearly half the
  production, and it comprises the whole of the second, and two pages of
  the third "fit." The first line and the last of the portion in my hands,
  testify to the greater antiquity and purity of the text there found; it
  begins&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"These gates be shut so wonderly well;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and it ends,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tyll they came to the kynge's palays."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is "<i>wonderous</i> well" in Copland's impression, and palace is
  there spelt "pallace," a more modern form of the word than <i>palays</i>.
  Just afterwards we have, in my fragment,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Streyght comen from oure kyng,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>instead of Copland's</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Streyght <i>come nowe</i> from our king."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Comen</i> is considerably more ancient than "come nowe;" so that,
  without pursuing this point farther, I may say that my fragment is not
  only an older specimen of typography than Copland's impression, but older
  still in its words and phraseology, a circumstance that communicates to
  it additional interest. I subjoin a few various readings, most, if not
  all, of them presenting a superior text than is to be met with elsewhere.
  Speaking of the porter at the gate of Carlisle, we are told&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And to the gate faste he throng."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Copland's edition omits <i>faste</i>, and it is not met with in Percy.
  In another place a rhyme is lost by an awkward transposition, "he saide"
  for <i>sayd he</i>; and farther on, in Copland's text, we have mention
  of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The justice with a quest of squyers."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>instead of "a quest of <i>swerers</i>," meaning of course the jury who
  had condemned Cloudesly "there hanged to be." Another blunder committed
  by Copland is the omission of a word, so that a line is left without its
  corresponding rhyme:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then Clowdysle cast hys eyen aside,</p>
      <p class="i1">And sawe his two bretheren <i>stande</i></p>
      <p>At the corner of the market-place,</p>
      <p class="i1">With theyr good bowes bent in theyr hand."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The word I print in Italics is entirely wanting in Copland. It is
  curious to see how Percy (<i>Reliques</i>, i. 157., ed. 1775) gets over
  the difficulty by following no known copy of the original:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then Cloudesle cast his eyen asyde,</p>
      <p class="i1">And saw hys brethren twaine</p>
      <p>At a corner of the market-place,</p>
      <p class="i1">Ready the justice for to slaine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Cloudesly is made to exclaim, in all editions but mine, "I see
  comfort," instead of "I see <i>good</i> comfort." However, it would
  perhaps be wearisome to press this matter farther, and I have said enough
  to set a few of your readers, zealous in such questions, rummaging their
  stores to ascertain whether any text with which they are acquainted,
  tallies with that I have above quoted.</p>

<h3>WITCHCRAFT.</h3>

  <p>Observing that you have lately admitted some articles on witchcraft,
  it may be interesting to make a note of two or three original papers, out
  of some in my possession, which were given to me many years ago by an old
  general officer, who served in the American war, and brought them with
  him to England about 1776. I send exact copies from the originals.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Ellacombe</span>.

  <p class="address">Rectory, Clyst St. George.

  <p>Whereas several persons, being by authority co<span
  class="over">m</span>itted to Ipswich Goall for fellony and witchcraft,
  and order being given that search should be made carefully upon their
  bodyes, to see if there nothing appeared preternaturall thereon: for that
  end, on July y<sup>e</sup> 4<sup>t</sup>h, 1692, a Jurie of one man and
  eight women were su<span class="over">m</span>oned to attend, and sworne
  to make dilligent search, and to give a true account of what they found,
  viz<sup>t</sup>.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Doctor Philemon Dance,</p>
      <p>Mrs. Joha<span class="over">n</span>a Diamond, midwife,</p>
      <p>Mrs. Grace Graves,</p>
      <p>Mrs. Mary Belcher,</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gennet Pengery,</p>
      <p>Ann Lovell,</p>
      <p>Francis Davis,</p>
      <p>Mary Browne,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Who, after search made in particular, give this account,
  viz<sup>t</sup>.&mdash;Upon the body of goodwife Estue they find three
  unnaturall teats, one under left arme, and one on the back side of her
  sholder-blade, one near to her secret parts on one thigh, which, being
  pricked throw with a pin, remained without sense, and did not bleed.</p>

  <p>That Abigail Barker, wife of Ebenezer Barker of Andiver, in the County

  aforesaid, wickedly, maliciously, and felloniously, a covenant with the
  Devill did make, and signed the Devill's Booke, and by the Devill was
  baptized, and renounced her former Christian baptism; and gave herselfe
  up to the Devill to serve him, and for the Devill to be her lord and

  Abigaill Barker is become a detestable witch, contrary to the peace of
  our Soveraigne Lord and Lady the King and Queene, their crowne and
  dignity, and the law in that case made and provided.</p>

  <p><i>Sep., '92.</i> The examination and confession of Abigail Barker,
  taken before John Hawthorn, Esq., and other their Majesties Justices:</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> How long have you been in the snare of the Devil?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Not above two yeares and a half.</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> At what place were you first overtaken?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> I am at present very much bewildered.&mdash;But a little
  after she said as followes:&mdash;About two yeare and a half agoe she was
  in great discontent of mynd, her husband being abroad, and she at home
  alone; at which tyme a black man appeared to her, and brought a book with
  him, to which he put her finger and made a black mark. She saith, her
  memory now failes her now more than ordinary; but said she gave herself
  up to the Devil to serve him, and he was her lord and master; and the
  Devil set a mark upon her legg, which mark is black and blue, and she
  apprehends is a witch mark; and said that she is a witch, and thinks that
  mark is the cause of her afflicting persons, though she thought nothing
  of it then till afterwards she heard of others having a mark upon them.
  She sayes, that some tyme after this the black man carryed her singly
  upon a pole to 5-mile pond, and there were 4 persones more upon another
  pole, viz. Mistriss Osgood, Goody Wilson, Goody Wardwell, Goody Tyler,
  and Hanneh Tyler. And when she came to the pond the Devil made a great
  light, and took her up and dypt her face in the pond, and she felt the
  water, and the Devil told her he was her lord and master, and she must
  serve him for ever. He made her renounce her former baptisme, and carryed
  her back upon the pole. She confesses she has afflicted the persones that
  accused her, viz. Sprague, Lester, and Sawdy, both at home and in the way
  comeing downe. The manner thus:&mdash;The Devil does it in her shape, and
  she consents unto, and clinches her hands together, and sayes the Devil
  cannot doe it in her shape without her consent. She sayes she was at a
  meeting at Moses Tyler's house, in company with Mistriss Osgood, Goody
  Wilson, Goody Tyler, and Hanah Tyler. She said the mark above was on her
  left legg by her shin. It is about two yeare agoe since she was baptized.
  She said that all this was true; and set her hand to the original as a
  true confession. <i>Noate</i>, that before this her confession she was
  taken dumb, and took Mr. Epps about the neck and pulled him down, thereby
  showing him how the black man bowed her down; and for one houre's tyme
  could not open her lips.</p>

  <p>I, underwritten, being appointed by authority to take the above
  examination, doe testify upon oath taken in court, that this is a true
  coppy of the substance of it to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<h3>SPRING, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Our ancestors had three verbs and three corresponding substantives to
  express the growth of plants, namely, <i>spring</i>, <i>shoot</i>, and
  <i>sprout</i>,&mdash;all indicative of rapidity of growth; for
  <i>sprout</i>, (Germ. <i>spriessen</i>) is akin to <i>spurt</i>, and
  denotes quickness, suddenness. The only one of these which remains in
  general use is <i>shoot</i>: for <i>sprout</i> is now only appropriated
  to the young growth from cabbage-stalks; and <i>spring</i> is heard no
  more save in <i>sprig</i>, which is evidently a corruption of it, and
  which now denotes a small slip or twig as we say, sprigs of laurel, bay,
  thyme, mint, rosemary, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Of the original meaning of <i>spring</i>, I have met but one clear
  instance; it is, however, an incontrovertible one, namely,</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Whoso spareth the <i>spring</i> (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> rod, switch), spilleth
  his children."&mdash;<i>Visions of Piers Plowman</i>, v. 2554., ed.
  Wright.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps this is also the meaning in&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i8"><i>Rape of Lucrece.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Spring</i> afterwards came to be used for underwood, &amp;c.
  Perhaps it answered to the present <i>coppice</i>, which is composed of
  the springs or shoots of the growth which has been cut down:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The lofty high wood and the lower <i>spring</i>."</p>

      <p class="i8"><i>Id.</i>, note.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was also used as equivalent to grove:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Unless it were</p>
      <p>The nightingale among the thick-leaved <i>spring</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8">Fletcher's <i>Faith. Shep.</i>, v. 1.</p>

  <p>where, however, it may be the coppice.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This hand Sibylla's golden boughs to guard them,</p>
      <p>Through hell and horror, to the Elysian <i>springs</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8">Massinger's <i>Bondman</i>, ii. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the following place Fairfax uses <i>spring</i> to express the
  "salvatichi soggiorni," i.&nbsp;e. <i>selva</i> of his original:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But if his courage any champion move</p>

  <p>and in</p>

  <p>it answers to <i>selva</i>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>he had probably in his mind the <i>cespuglio</i> in the first canto of
  the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>; for <i>spring</i> had not been used in the
  sense of thickets, clumps, by any previous English poet. I am of opinion
  that <i>spring</i> occurs for the last time in our poetry in the
  following lines of Pope:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings,</p>
      <p>And heap'd with products of Sabæan <i>springs</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Messiah</i>, 93.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Johnson renders the last line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cinnameos cumulos, Nabathæi munera <i>veris</i>;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and this is probably the sense in which the place has generally been
  understood. But let any one read the preceding quotations, and reflect on
  what a diligent student Pope was of the works of his predecessors, and
  perhaps he will think with me.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>The Passage in King Henry VIII., Act III. Sc.</i> 1. (Vol. vii.,
  pp. 5. 111. 183. 494.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> has
  done perfectly right to "call me to account" for a rash and unadvised
  assertion, in saying that we must interpolate <i>been</i> in the passage
  in <i>King Henry VIII.</i>, Act III. Sc. 2., after <i>have</i>; for even
  that would not make it intelligible. So far I stand corrected. The
  passages, however that are cited, are not parallel cases. In the first we
  have the word <i>loyalty</i> to complete the sense:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ·&nbsp; &nbsp;My loyalty,</p>
      <p>Which ever has [been] and ever shall be growing."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the second, the word <i>deserved</i> is clearly pointed out as
  being understood, from the occurrence of <i>deserve</i> after
  <i>will</i>:</p>

  <p>"I have spoken better of you than you have [deserved] or will deserve
  at my hands."</p>

  <p>I will assist <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby's</span> position with
  another example from <i>Rich. II.</i>, Act V. Sc. 5.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ·&nbsp; &nbsp;like silly beggars,</p>
      <p>Who sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,</p>
      <p>That many have [sat] and others must sit there."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And even from a much later writer, Bolingbroke:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This dedication may serve for almost any book that has, is, or shall
  be published."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Where we must supply <i>been</i> after <i>has</i>. But in the passage
  I attempted, and I think successfully, to set right, admitting that
  custom would allow of the ellipsis of the participle <i>been</i>, after
  the auxiliary <i>have</i>, to what can "am, have, and will be" possibly
  refer?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ·&nbsp; &nbsp;I do professe</p>
      <p>That for your highness' good, I euer labour'd</p>
      <p>More then mine owne, that am, haue, and will be."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What? Add <i>true</i> at the end of the line, and it mars the verse,
  but make the probable correction of <i>true</i> for <i>haue</i>, and you
  get excellent sense without any ellipsis. I am as averse to interpolation
  or alteration of the text, when sense can by any rational supposition be
  made of it, as my opponent, or any true lover of the poet and the
  integrity of his language, can possibly be; but I see nothing rational in
  refusing to correct an almost self-evident misprint, which would redeem a
  fine passage that otherwise must always remain a stumbling-block to the
  most intelligent reader. We have all I trust but one object, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
  to free the text of our great poet from obvious errors occasioned by
  extremely incorrect printing in the folios, and at the same time to
  strictly watch over all attempts at its corruption by unnecessary
  meddling. This, and not the displaying of our own ingenuity in
  conjectures, ought to be our almost sacred duty; at least, I feel
  conscious that it is mine.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The notable quotation of this line by the Earl of Derby, in the Lords,
  on Monday evening, April 25, has once more reminded me of my unanswered
  Query respecting it, Vol. vi., p. 270.</p>

  <p>On the 26th February (Vol. vii., p. 217.) <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span> was good enough to say, that his only <!-- Page 450
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page450"></a>{450}</span> reason for
  not answering it was, that he had not then within his reach the copy of
  "N. &amp; Q." wherein it had been proposed; politely adding, that if I
  would reprint the Query, he would at once answer it.</p>

  <p>Supposing, however, that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> absence
  from his library would be only temporary, I deemed it less troublesome to
  the Editor of "N. &amp; Q." to wait until <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span> could refer to the Query, as already printed.</p>

  <p>Two months have since elapsed, and I now no longer hesitate to ask the
  Editor for an opportunity of again referring to it, trusting that a
  sufficient excuse will be found in the importance of the subject, as
  affecting the fundamental sense of a passage in Shakspeare.</p>

  <p class="author">A. E. B.

  <p class="address">Leeds.

  <p><i>Mr. J. Payne Collier's "Notes and Emendations."</i>&mdash;There can
  be no doubt that many of these emendations are rational and judicious;
  but I cannot help thinking, <i>on the whole</i>, that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> has rather overrated their value, and
  placed too implicit faith in the infallibility of his unknown guide. At
  all events, there is not a shadow of authority given for any one of the
  corrections, and we have therefore a full right to try them, as the
  lawyers would say, "upon the merits;" or, in other words, to treat them
  as mere speculative alterations, and to adopt or reject them, as may
  appear advisable in each particular case. It is difficult to conjecture
  what can have been the position in life, or the occupation of this
  mysterious annotator. That his pursuits were not purely literary, I think
  is plain: first, from the very circumstance of his not authenticating any
  of his notes, which a literary inquirer would certainly have done; and,
  secondly, from the very minute attention which is paid to the
  <i>business</i> of the scene and the movements of the actors. These
  considerations, coupled with the fact of his frequently striking out
  whole passages of the text (which a literary enthusiast would <i>not</i>
  have done), would at first lead us to suppose that the writer was a
  theatrical manager, and that the alterations were made to suit either the
  fancies, or perhaps the peculiar qualifications of certain performers.
  But in this case one can hardly suppose that the remarks would have
  extended to more than a certain number of plays, which were most
  frequently acted. Thus much, however, appears certain, that the
  commentaries are rather those of an <i>habitual play-goer</i>, than of a
  studious critic; and it will be easy to show that a great portion of the
  new readings he proposes are really changes <i>for the worse</i>, while a
  still larger number are at least unnecessary! I shall content myself with
  only a few instances, on this occasion, as I am unwilling to encroach too
  far on your space; but I can easily multiply them, if I am encouraged to
  renew the subject.</p>

  <p>In the first place, I differ from <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>
  entirely as to the famous passage from <i>Henry VIII.</i>, p. 324., which
  he brings so prominently forward as to give it special notice in his
  Introduction. To me, I confess, the phrase&mdash;</p>

  <p>appears quite tame and poor in comparison with</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To steal from spiritual <i>leisure</i> a brief span,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and, moreover, destroys all the poetry of the thought. Nor can I see
  the slightest difficulty in the <i>sense</i> of the original passage. The
  king means to say that Wolsey cannot steal from the <i>little leisure</i>
  afforded him by his spiritual labours "a brief span, to keep his earthly
  audit:" and surely this is much more poetical than the substituted
  passage.</p>

  <p>In p. 323., from the same play, we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"to the sharp'st <i>kind</i> of justice,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>transformed to "sharp'st <i>knife</i> of justice:" but I cannot assent
  to this change. The obvious meaning of the poet is, that the contempt of
  the world, "<i>shutting all doors</i>" against the accused, is a sharper
  <i>kind</i> of justice than any which the law could inflict: but, to be
  given up to "the sharp'st <i>knife</i> of justice" could only mean, being
  consigned to the public executioner,&mdash;which was just what Katherine
  was deprecating.</p>

  <p>In p. 325. the lines relating to Wolsey's foundations at Ipswich and
  Oxford are printed thus in the folio&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"one of which fell with him,</p>
      <p>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>that is, unwilling to outlive the virtues which prompted it,&mdash;a
  passage teeming with poetical feeling: but the commentator has ruthlessly
  altered it to&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Unwilling to outlive the <i>good man</i> did it;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which, I submit, not only destroys all the poetry, but is decidedly
  <i>not English!</i></p>

  <p>The next passage I would notice is from <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>,
  p. 76. How, I would ask, can the phrase&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And sorrow wag,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>be a misprint for "call sorrow joy?" No compositor, or scribe either,
  could possibly be misled by any sound from the "reader" into such a
  mistake as that! The words "and sorrow wag," I admit, are not sense; but
  the substitution of "call sorrow joy" strikes me as bald and common-place
  in the extreme, and there is no pretence for its having any authority.
  If, then, we are to have a mere fanciful emendation, why not "bid sorrow
  wag?" This would be doing far less violence to the printed text, for it
  would only require the alteration of two letters in the word "and;" while
  it would preserve the Shakspearian character of the passage. "Wag" is a
  favourite expression in <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page451"></a>{451}</span> the comedies of the Bard, and occurs
  repeatedly in his works. The passage would then run thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</p>
      <p><i>Bid sorrow wag</i>&mdash;cry hem! when he should groan."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In p. 73. we find&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Soul-tainted flesh," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>substituted for "<i>foul</i> tainted flesh;" and we are told that the
  critics have been all wrong, who supposed that Shakspeare intended any
  "metaphor from the kitchen!" If so, what meaning can be attached to the
  line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And salt too little which may season give?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If that is not a metaphor from the kitchen, I know not what could be?
  I still believe that "foul tainted flesh" is the correct reading. The
  expression "<i>soul</i>-tainted flesh" is not intelligible. It should
  rather be "<i>soul-tainting</i> flesh." The <i>soul</i> may be tainted by
  the <i>flesh</i>: but how the <i>flesh</i> can be <i>soul-tainted</i>, I
  cannot understand.</p>

  <p>Turning further back, to p. 69., we find it asserted, quite
  dogmatically, that the word "truths" of the folios ought to be "proofs;"
  but no reason whatever is offered for the change. I cannot help thinking
  that "seeming <i>truths</i>" is much the most poetical expression, while
  in "seeming <i>proofs</i>" there is something like redundancy,&mdash;to
  say nothing of the phrase being infinitely more common-place!</p>

  <p>In the play of the <i>Tempest</i>, p. 4., the beautiful
  passage&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"he being thus <i>lorded</i></p>
      <p>Not only with what my revenue yielded," &amp;c.,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is degraded into "he being thus <i>loaded</i>," &amp;c. Can there be a
  moment's doubt that "lorded" was the word used by Shakspeare? It is
  completely in his style, which was on all occasions to coin verbs out of
  substantives, if he could. "He being thus <i>lorded</i>," i.&nbsp;e.
  <i>ennobled</i> "with what my revenue yielded," is surely a far superior
  expression to "being thus <i>loaded</i>,"&mdash;as if the poet were
  speaking of a costermonger's donkey!</p>

  <p>Again, in p. 10.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wherefore <i>this</i> ghastly looking?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or, this ghastly appearance? Who will venture to say, that the
  substitution of "<i>thus ghastly</i> looking" is not decidedly a change
  for the worse?</p>

  <p>In the Merchant of Venice, p. 118.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"and leave itself <i>unfurnished</i>,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is altered to "leave itself <i>unfinished</i>!" I confess I cannot see
  the slightest warrant for this change. The words&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"having made one,</p>
      <p>Methinks <span class="scac">IT</span> should have power to steal <i>both his</i>,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>distinctly show that the author was alluding to the <i>eye</i> only,
  and not to the <i>portrait</i> and how could the eye (already
  <i>made</i>) describe itself as <i>unfinished</i>? Surely the sense is
  <i>unfurnished</i>, that is, <i>unfurnished</i> with its companion, or
  probably with the other accessories required to complete the
  portrait.</p>

  <p>P. 119. has the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And swearing 'til my very <i>roof</i> was dry,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>transmogrified into&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And swearing 'til my very <i>tongue</i> was dry."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now, why "this lame and impotent conclusion?" What can be a more
  common expression than the "roof of the mouth?" and it is just the part
  which is most affected by a sensation of dryness and pricking, after any
  excitement in speaking, whereas the <i>tongue</i> is not the member that
  suffers!</p>

  <p>In <i>As You Like It</i>, p. 127., in the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mistress dispatch you with your <i>safest haste</i>,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>the last two words are made "fastest haste," which, to say the least,
  are tautology, and are like talking, of the "highest height", or the the
  "deepest depth!" Surely, the original form of words, "Dispatch you with
  your <i>safest haste</i>;" that is, with as much haste as is consistent
  with your personal safety&mdash;is much more dignified and polished
  address from the duke to a <i>lady</i>, and at the same time more
  poetical!</p>

  <p>In p. 129.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The constant <i>service</i> of the antique world,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is converted into</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The constant <i>favour</i> of the antique world:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>in which line I cannot discover any sense. If I might hazard a guess,
  I should suggest that the error is in the <i>second</i> word, "service,"
  and that it ought to be "servants:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When <i>servants</i> sweat for duty, not for meed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, p. 143., the substitution of
  "<i>Warwickshire</i> ale" for "sheer ale" strikes me as very far-fetched,
  and wholly unnecessary. There is no defect of sense in the term
  "<i>sheer</i> ale." Sly means to say, he was "fourteen pence on the score
  for ale alone:" just as one speaks of "sheer nonsense," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
  nothing but nonsense, "sheer buffoonery," "sheer malice," &amp;c. Why
  should Sly talk of being in debt for <i>Warwickshire</i> ale at Wincot?
  If he kind been drinking ale from Staffordshire, or Derbyshire, or Kent,
  he might possibly have named the county it came from; but to talk of
  <i>Warwickshire</i> ale within a few miles of Stratford-on-Avon seems
  absurd. It is as if a man came from Barclay and Perkins's, and talked of
  having been drinking "<i>London</i> porter."</p>

  <p>In p. 144., I submit, with great deference, that turning "Aristotle's
  checks" into "Aristotle's ethics" is the very reverse of an improvement.
  What can be more intelligible than the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And so devote to Aristotle's <i>checks</i>;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>that is, to the checks which Aristotle's rules impose upon profligacy?
  The idea is more poetical, <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page452"></a>{452}</span> and the line runs more smoothly; while
  the altered line is prosaic in comparison, and the metre is not
  correct.</p>

  <p>My dwindling space warns me that I must very soon pause; but these
  examples can be extended <i>ad infinitum</i>, should another opportunity
  be afforded me.</p>

  <p>The instances of alterations simply <i>unnecessary</i> are too
  numerous to be recorded here. I have already a list of forty odd,
  selected from only eight plays.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Bart.</i>&mdash;As those who have read
  the deeply interesting memoirs of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton are aware, he
  was placed at a school in Donnybrook in the year 1802, and shortly after
  "entered" the University of Dublin. His success in that seat of learning,
  where able competitors were many in number, was brilliant; for "on the
  14th of April in the same year [1807], he received his thirteenth
  premium, and also the highest honour of the university,&mdash;the gold
  medal. With these distinctions, and the four silver medals from the
  Historical Society, he prepared to return to England." In fact, so high
  did his character stand, that a proposal was made to him by the electors
  (which, however, he deemed it prudent to decline) to come forward as a
  candidate for the representation of the university in the imperial
  parliament, and good grounds were given him to expect a triumphant
  return.</p>

  <p>Now, this man was doubtless an honour to the "silent(?) sister" in
  Ireland; and, as an Irishman, I feel some little degree of pride in our
  having educated him so well for his subsequent career. With surprise,
  then, do I find, on referring to the <i>Dublin University Calendar</i>
  for the present year, the name of a "Mr. <i>John Powell</i> Buxton" in
  the list of gold medallists. The editor appears to be sadly ignorant of
  the proper person, and cannot lay the blunder at the printer's door,
  having very unaccountably repeated it from year to year. I have taken the

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>SEAL OF WILLIAM D'ALBINI.</h3>

  <p>A few years since there was published a <i>History of the Parish of
  Attleburgh, in Norfolk</i>, by the then rector, Dr. Barrett. It is a very
  handsome volume in quarto, and reflects great credit upon the learning
  and taste of the reverend editor.</p>

  <p>What I wish more particularly to allude to is an engraving of the seal
  of William de Albini, who was called "William with the Strong Hand;" of
  whom Dugdale records, that having distinguished himself at a tournament
  appointed by a queen of France, then a widow, she became so enamoured of
  him that she offered him marriage. But he, having plighted his troth to
  Adeliza, widow to <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page453"></a>{453}</span> King Henry I. of England, refused her. In
  revenge for this refusal, the queen of France inveigled him into a den in
  the garden, where was a fierce lion. Being in this danger, he rolled his
  mantle about his arm, and putting his hand into the mouth of the beast,
  pulled out his tongue by the root; followed the queen to her palace, and
  gave it to one of her maids to present to her. Returning to England with
  the fame of this glorious exploit, he was forthwith advanced to the
  earldom of Arundel, and for his arms the lion given him.</p>

  <p>Amongst the many illustrations in Dr. Barrett's book is the seal of
  this William de Albini, representing a knight on horseback, in the usual
  style of such knightly seals; but in front of the knight is a young lion,
  and under the feet of the horse some sort of animal of the lizard
  kind.</p>

  <p>In elucidation of this seal, there is a long and elaborate note, with
  remarks by Mr. Hawkins of the British Museum, with a view of showing that
  the device on this seal alludes to the story of his combat with the
  lion.</p>

  <p>The attempt to establish this point appears to me amusing; for there
  seems nothing on the face of the seal different from the usual seals of
  royal and knightly rank in ancient times.</p>

  <p>It strikes me, that the true interpretation of this device, and the
  introduction of the lion and the lizard-like animal under the horse's
  feet, may be found in the 13th verse of Psalm xci.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon
  shalt thou tread under thy feet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I should like to learn from some of your correspondents, whether this
  Psalm, or this portion of it, was used in the solemnities attendant on
  the installation of a knight, which would tend much to confirm my
  conjecture.</p>

<h3>FORMS OF JUDICIAL OATH.</h3>

  <p>The forms of an oath are different among different denominations of
  Christians. The Roman Catholics of the Continent swear by raising the
  hand; the Scotch Presbyterians follow the same practice. The Protestants
  of the Church of England are sworn on the Gospels; so also are the Irish
  Roman Catholics. The Quakers reject every form of oath, and confine
  themselves to a simple affirmation. Upon these points I beg leave to
  submit the following Queries.</p>

  <p>1. What form of judicial oath was first sanctioned by the professors
  of Christianity as a body? It is stated in Haydn's <i>Dictionary of
  Dates</i>, that "oaths were taken on the Gospels so early as <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 528." How were they taken before then?</p>

  <p>2. Did the practice of swearing on the Gospels prevail in England
  before the Reformation? If not, at what period was it introduced?</p>

  <p>3. When was that form of oath first adopted by the Irish; and was its
  adoption a voluntary proceeding on their part, or enforced by legislative
  enactment?</p>

  <p>4. Was the practice of raising the hand in use in Scotland before the
  Reformation?</p>

  <p>5. At what period was the latter form adopted by the Continental
  Christians, in lieu of the more solemn oath on the Gospels?</p>

  <p>6. Are there now, or have there been at any former period, any forms
  of judicial oath in use among Christians, other than the forms above
  mentioned?</p>

  <p><i>Haveringemere.</i>&mdash;Gervase of Tilbury, in the 4th book of his
  <i>Otia Imperialia</i>, sect. 88., mentions a certain pond or mere lying
  near the confines of Wales, and named Haveringemere, of which the
  peculiarity is, that if a person passing over it in a boat utters, in a
  loud voice, certain opprobrious words, a commotion arises in the waters
  and sinks the boat. The words, as printed in the edition of Leibnitz
  (Leibnitii <i>Scriptores Brunsvicenses</i>, tom. i. p. 990.), are
  "<i>Prout haveringemere</i> aut <i>allethophe cunthefere</i>;" which he
  explains to mean, "<i>Phrut</i> tibi, mare, et omnibus qui te
  transfretant." He adds with great simplicity: "Et satis mirandum, quod
  aquæ hujus modi concipiunt indignationes." It is plain that we ought to
  read, "Phrut Haveringemere, and alle thai that on thee fere"
  (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> ferry). <i>Phrut</i> or <i>prut</i> is a word of contempt,
  of which Mr. Halliwell gives an instance, <i>s.&nbsp;v.</i> Prut, from an
  Harleian MS.: "And seyth <i>prut</i> for thy cursing prest." Is anything
  known of this mere at the present day, and is there any remnant of this
  old superstition? Gervase wrote his book anno 1211.</p>

  if it is really so great a curiosity. It is a fine folio, profusely
  illustrated. I subjoin a copy of the title-page:</p>

  <p><i>The Vinegar Plant.</i>&mdash;Is it indigenous or imported? Some
  botanists and <i>savans</i> who have examined the subject take the former
  view. I should be inclined to take the latter, for the following among
  other reasons:&mdash;First, because it is known that many specimens of it
  <i>have been so introduced</i> from various quarters. Secondly, because
  in all the attempts to produce it that I have heard of, including some
  experiments made by myself, in no instance has a specimen been procured
  by means of any of the moulds that are of spontaneous growth in this
  country, which has entirely resembled the vinegar plant, or which has
  been so efficient in the production of vinegar. Thirdly, because in
  tropical and warm climates abnormal variations of vegetable productions
  are much more likely to originate, and to become naturalised, than in
  this country. If imported, perhaps some of your correspondents could say
  where it was originally brought from.</p>

  <p><i>Westminster Parishes.</i>&mdash;What are the names of the
  respective parishes in the city of Westminster in 1630; how far back do
  their records extend; and what charge would be made for a search in them?
  I wish to trace a family whose ancestor was born in that city, but in
  what parish I am ignorant. Were any churches in <i>Westminster</i>, as
  distinguished from <i>London</i>, destroyed in the Great Fire?</p>

  <p><i>Harley Family.</i>&mdash;Can any reader of your invaluable
  miscellany give an account of Thomas Harley, citizen of London, who died
  in the year 1670, ætat. fifty-six? The Thomas Harley referred to
  possessed good estate in the county of Leicester, <!-- Page 455 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page455"></a>{455}</span> particularly at
  Osgathorpe, Walton-on-Wolds, Snibston, and Heather. He founded a hospital
  at Osgathorpe, and endowed the same at 60<i>l.</i> for the maintenance
  and support of six clergymen's widows. Moreover he also erected a
  free-school, which he endowed with 60<i>l.</i> a year. He married Mary,
  widow of William Kemp, citizen of London. His daughter, and sole heiress,
  married into the family of Bainbrigge of Lockington Hall, county of
  Leicester; which alliance carried with it the estate of Thomas Harley
  into that family.</p>

  <p>The arms of Thomas Harley are: Crest, a lion's head rampant; shield,
  Or, bend cotized sable.</p>

  <p>Is the foregoing family a branch of that of Herefordshire, now
  ennobled; or does it come down from one of the name anterior to the time
  when such earldom was made patent, viz. from Sir Richard Harley, 28
  Edward I.: whose armorial bearings, according to one annalist, is
  mentioned as <i>Or, bend cotized sable</i>?</p>

  <p>Brian de Harley, son of Sir Robert Harley, in the reign of Henry IV.,
  changed his crest; which was a buck's head proper, to a lion rampant,
  gules, issuing out of a tower, triple towered proper.</p>

  <p><i>Enough.</i>&mdash;Was this word always pronounced as at present,
  <i>enuf</i>? I am inclined to think not; for Waller, in his poem "On a
  War with Spain," rhymes it with <i>bough</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Let the brave generals divide that bough,</p>
      <p>Our great Protector hath such wreaths <i>enough</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And again, in his "Answer to Sir John Suckling's Verses," he couples
  it with <i>plough</i>, in those anti-Malthusian lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The world is of a large extent we see,</p>
      <p>And must be peopled: children there must be!&mdash;</p>
      <p>So must bread too; but since there are <i>enough</i></p>
      <p>Born to that drudgery, what need we plough?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When did the change of pronunciation take place? Perhaps some reader
  of "N. &amp; Q." can also give the etymology of the word.</p>

  <p><i>Archbishop Magee.</i>&mdash;In a committee of the House of Lords,
  1825, Lord Holland asked Archbishop Magee: "Does your grace really think
  that there is any person capable of holding such a monstrous opinion, as
  that the Roman Catholic religion is idolatrous?" The Archbishop calmly
  fixed his eyes on Lord Holland's countenance, and replied "My Lord,
  <i>some have sworn to it</i>."&mdash;I only quote so much of the anecdote
  (which your readers will find in Archbishop Magee's <i>Works</i>, vol. i.
  p. 67., 1842) as my purpose requires.</p>

  <p>As reported in <i>The Times</i>, on April 18, 1853, Lord Lansdown,
  speaking of an old committee in the House of Lords, said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"During those two days, a right reverend prelate was examined; and he
  was required to state upon oath whether the Creed of St. Athanasius was
  necessary to salvation. The reply was, 'He would not say whether it was
  that, but a great many persons had sworn that it was.'"</p>

  <p><i>Carpets at Rome.</i>&mdash;In a cutting from a newspaper or
  periodical, apparently of the year 1790, narrating an accident that
  happened to Lady Augusta Clavering, daughter of the Duke of Argyle
  (whilst staying at Rome) by her muslin dress catching fire, it is
  said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Fortunately, the gentlemen did not lose their presence of mind; and
  there happening to be a carpet in the room, <i>a thing very uncommon in

  <p>Can any of your readers oblige me by informing me whether it is a

  <p><i>Gloves at Fairs.</i>&mdash;I think that I have read that at some
  large fair it was customary to hang out on the town-hall a large gilt
  glove, as a token of freedom from arrest for debt during the period that
  the fair lasted. Can any of your correspondents inform me if such was the
  case, and where? In Halliwell's <i>Dictionary</i>, "hoisting the glove"
  is said to be practised at Lammas Fair, in Devonshire: but why? In the
  east of England certain village fairs are called
  <i>Gants</i>,&mdash;Mattishall Gant, &amp;c. Forby derives this from
  A.-S. <i>gan</i>, to go; but may it not have some reference to the French

  <p><i>Mr. Caryl or Caryll.</i>&mdash;Every one knows that the <i>Rape of

  Pope to have been private secretary to James II.'s queen before the <!--
  Page 456 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>{456}</span>
  Revolution. It also appears in the Prolegomena to the <i>Life of
  James</i>, that two royal warrants issued at St. Germains by the
  abdicated monarch and his son the Pretender in 1701 and 1707, are
  counter-signed <i>Caryll</i> as Secretary of State. Is there any doubt
  that this is the same person; and if not, is there any account of when
  and on what terms he returned to England? where he must have been again
  domiciled in 1711, and some years after, during which period he
  corresponded with Pope. His family was settled near East Grinstead, in
  Sussex.</p>

  <p><i>Early Reaping-machines.</i>&mdash;Have the former Numbers of "N.

  entitled <i>The Complete Farmer, or a General Dictionary of
  Husbandry</i>; containing the various methods of improving the land,
  &amp;c., together with great variety of new discoveries and improvements,
  the 4th edition, by a society of gentlemen. There is no date on the
  title-page; but from internal evidence, I am led to think that the work
  was not published before 1780. If it be thought desirable, I shall be
  happy to send an extract from the work, giving an account of the machine,
  or, if drawings be admitted into the pages of "N. &amp; Q.," the work
  might be sent to the Editor.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p>"<i>Diary of a Self-Observer.</i>"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> may be in some degree compared with
  the <i>Private Diary of a Self-Observer</i> (<i>Geheimes Tagebuch von
  einem Beobachter seiner selbst</i>) which has in our own days been read
  with so great eagerness and sympathy. Not as if the celebrated author of
  the latter work did not in many ways deserve a preference above the
  African bishop," &amp;c.&mdash;Schröckh's <i>Kirchengeschichte</i>, xv.
  376.: Leipzig, 1790.</p>

  <p>What is the book here meant, and by whom was it written?</p>

  <p class="author">J. C. R.

<div class="note">
  <p>[This <i>Diary</i> is by the celebrated John Caspar Lavater, author of
  <i>Essays on Physiognomy</i>. In 1769 he commenced it under the title of
  <i>Secret Journal of a Self-Observer</i>. In the following year it fell
  into the hands of a stranger, and from him it was transmitted to
  Zollikofer, with such alterations, however, as to conceal the real
  author. Zollikofer, thinking that it contained much useful matter, had it
  printed; and among others, sent a copy of it to his friend Lavater, who
  was beyond measure astonished at the sight. However, as it was now before
  the world in a somewhat disfigured state, Lavater edited it with the
  necessary alterations, and with an additional volume: Leipsic, 1771 and
  1773. In 1795, the German original was translated into English by the
  Rev. Peter Will, of the Reformed German Chapel in the Savoy, in two vols.
  8vo. Prefixed to the second volume is a letter from Lavater to the
  editor, with the editor's reply. See Chalmers's <i>Biographical

  <p><i>Jockey.</i>&mdash;Mr. Borrow, in his Introduction to <i>The Gypsies

  <p>"The English gypsies are constant attendants at the race-course. What
  jockey is not? Perhaps jockeyism originated with them, and even racing,
  at least in England. Jockeyism properly implies <i>the management of a
  whip</i>; and the word <i>jockey</i> is neither more nor less than the
  term, slightly modified, by which they designate the formidable whip
  which they usually carry, at present in general use amongst
  horse-traffickers under the title of jockey-whips."</p>

  <p><i>Boyle Lectures.</i>&mdash;In that valuable and well-executed work,

  following years only being marked "Unknown:"&mdash;1729, 1733-5, 1746,
  1753-5, 1764-5. With these few omissions, the names of preachers from
  1692 to 1807 are given without exception. Will some of your
  correspondents kindly supply the hiatus above referred to? Possibly the
  lectures for those years were not printed, as was the case very
  frequently (see columns 405. 406. <i>Cyc. Bibl.</i>)&mdash;so there may

<h3>THE DISCOVERY AND RECOVERY OF MSS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 161. 261. 340.; Vol. iv., p. 282.;
Vol. vii., p. 354.)</p>

  <p>I am glad to see that a subject to which I have at various times
  attempted to turn public attention, has at least been responded to by one
  voice. When the "N. &amp; Q." was first established, I felt that there
  was now at least one place where it was possible to print historical
  documents of various kinds, and no one can deny that at various times
  very interesting and important papers have been made publicly available,
  which might otherwise have escaped notice. I may instance a very
  interesting account of the inquest on Chatterton, which I have myself, in
  a sketch of that ill-fated <!-- Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page457"></a>{457}</span> youth's fate, been the first to make use
  of for biographical purposes.</p>

  <p>It is still my conviction that at some time or other an association
  for such purposes will be formed, and I must attain earnestly entreat
  those persons whose position would command assistance, and whose learning
  and opportunities would aid the cause I am advocating, to give some sign
  of their favourable intention toward such a scheme. I must once more
  place this very important matter before the eyes of the public; I trust
  that my appeal may not be in vain.</p>

  <p>See how in other cases, when something offers itself promising
  amusement and instruction, societies can be formed and spring into life
  and activity at once. For instance, I might adduce the beautiful and
  useful processes of photography; within the short space of a few months
  the art has been brought to a high decree of excellence: a Photographical
  Institute is, I believe, now in active working, there is a photographical
  journal, besides the continued and unwearying co-operation of "N. &amp;
  Q." itself. Why may not historical documents have something of the same
  sort? For a slight sum (but a few shillings a year), if the reading
  public were willing, such a society might be founded, and many invaluable
  documents of every description placed where they would be available for
  the historian, for the archæologist, for the editor, and for the general
  inquirer.</p>

  <p>Let me hope that something may be proposed; I have myself hunted
  through dusty MS. folios, quartos, duodecimos innumerable, and my
  investigations have not been wholly useless.</p>

  <p>If there be any who look with a favourable eye upon these hints, I
  shall be glad to hear from them.</p>

<h3>"THE WHIPPIAD."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 393. 417.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps a few lines from a fellow-collegian of Reginald Heber, during
  his last years of residence at Brazenoze College, may throw light on this
  discussion.</p>

  <p>My contemporary MS. copy of <i>The Whippiad</i> contains Heber's
  <i>own notes</i>, additional ones by myself, explanatory of places and
  persons mentioned, autographs of the latter, and Blackwood's printed copy
  (the subject of inquiry), No. 333., July, 1843.</p>

  <p>The <i>notes</i> subjoined to Blackwood's printed copy are <i>Heber's
  notes</i>, varying only from my MS. copy in immaterial points.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>epigram</i> mentioned in p. 417., the two first stanzas
  were by Heber, and written (as I think) after his election to All Souls.
  The third was attributed to Mr. Wilson, the learned High Master of
  Clithero School.</p>

  <p>Very many <i>jeux d'esprit</i> by Heber, relative to convivialities
  and passing events in Brazenoze and All Souls, live in the memory and
  MSS. of his surviving friends; but their amiable author would doubtless
  have wished them to be forgotten, with the subjects to which they
  related. The forbearance of Mr. Halliwell made him vainly anxious for the
  suppression of <i>The Whippiad</i>.</p>

  <p>I subjoin from Heber's autograph a Song for a Bow Meeting, near St.
  Asaph, in or about 1808. It has an airy freshness, and is (as I believe)
  unpublished.</p>

  namely, the rapid ignition of the human body (which <i>per se</i> is not
  combustible) by contact with flame, as a consequence of the saturation of
  its tissues by alcohol:</p>

  <p>The following case is related, on the authority of Dr. Schofield,
  Upper Canada, in the <i>Journal of the American Temperance Union</i> for
  March, 1837:&mdash;A young man, aged twenty-five, had been an habitual
  drunkard for many years. One evening at about eleven o'clock he went to a
  blacksmith's shop: he was then full of liquor, though not thoroughly
  drunk. The blacksmith, who had just crossed the road, was suddenly
  alarmed by the breaking forth of a brilliant conflagration in his shop.
  He rushed across, and threw open the door, and there stood the man,
  erect, in the midst of a widely-extended silver-coloured flame, bearing,
  as he described it, exactly the appearance of the wick of a burning
  candle in the midst of its own flame. He seized him by the shoulder, and
  jerked him to the door, and the flame was instantly extinguished. There
  was no fire in the shop, and no articles likely to cause combustion
  within reach of the individual. In the course of a short time a general
  sloughing came on, and the flesh was almost wholly removed in the
  dressing, leaving the bones and a few of the large blood-vessels

  continued to the thirteenth day, when he died, a loathsome, ill-featured,

  Parliament, it is probable that Lambert procured the roots from some
  friend in the island.</p>

  <p>The exact date of his arrival as a prisoner in Guernsey is fixed by a

<h3>THE "SALT-PETER-MAN."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 377.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent J. O. asks for information to No. 4. of his notes
  respecting the "salt-peter-man," so quaintly described by Lord Coke as a
  troublesome person. Before the discovery and importation of rough nitre
  from the East Indies, the supply of that very important ingredient in the
  manufactory of gunpowder was very inadequate to the quantity required;
  and this country having in the early part of the seventeenth century to
  depend almost entirely upon its own resources. Charles I. issued a
  proclamation in 1627, which set forth that the saltpetre makers were
  never able to furnish the realm with a third part of the saltpetre
  required, especially in time of war. The proclamation had reference to a
  patent that had been granted in 1625 to Sir John Brooke and Thomas
  Russel, for making saltpetre by a new invention, which gave them power to
  collect the animal fluids (ordered by the same proclamation to be
  preserved by families for this purpose), once in twenty-four hours in
  summer, and in forty-eight hours in winter. This royal proclamation was
  very obnoxious and inconvenient to the good people of England, increased
  as it was by the power granted to the saltpetre makers to dig up the
  floors of all dove-houses, stables, cellars, &amp;c., for the purpose of
  carrying away the earth, the proprietors being at the same time
  prohibited from laying such floors with anything but "mellow earth," that
  greater facility might be given them. This power, in the hands of men
  likely to be appointed to fulfil such duties, was no doubt subject to
  much abuse for the purposes of extortion, making, as Lord Coke states,
  "simple people believe that Lee (the salt-peter-man) will, without their
  leave, breake up the floore of their dwelling-house, unless they will
  compound with him to the contrary." The new and uncertain process for
  obtaining the constituents of nitre having failed to answer the purpose
  for which the patent was granted, an act was passed in 1656, forbidding
  the saltpetre makers to dig in houses or lands without leave of the
  owner: and this is the point to which the learned commentator of the law,
  in his <i>Discouerie of the Abuses and Corruption of Officers</i>,
  alludes, when "any such fellowe if you can meete with all, let his
  misdemenor be presented, that he may be taught better to understand his
  office." In England, up to about the period when these curious acts of
  parliament were passed, the right of all soil impregnated with animal
  matter was claimed by the crown for this peculiar purpose; and in France
  the rubbish of old houses, earth from stables, slaughter-houses, and all
  refuse places, was considered to belong to the Government, till 1778,
  when a similar edict, to relieve the people from the annoyances of the
  saltpetre makers, was made.</p>

<h3>METRICAL PSALMS AND HYMNS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 119. 198.)</p>

  <p>In reply to your correspondent <span class="sc">Arun</span>, who
  inquired about the origin and authority of metrical psalms and hymns in
  churches, in addition to an extract from one of Bishop Cosin's letters on
  the subject, I referred also to the treatise commonly known as Watson's
  <i>Deduction</i>, but of which treatise Heylin was in fact the author. I
  have recently met with a passage in Heylin's <i>History of the
  Reformation</i> (ann. 1552, Lond., 1674, p. 127.) which seems to contain
  the rudiment or first germ of the <i>Deduction</i>, and to which <span
  class="sc">Arun</span> therefore (if not already acquainted with it) may
  be glad to be referred:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"About this time (says Heylin) the Psalms of David did first begin to
  be composed in English meetter by one Thomas Sternhold, one of the grooms
  of the Privy Chamber; who, translating no more than thirty-seven, left
  both example and encouragement to John Hopkins and others to dispatch the
  rest:&mdash;a device first taken up in France by one Clement Marot, one
  of the grooms of the bedchamber to King Francis the First; who, being
  much addicted to poetry, and having some acquaintance with those which
  were thought to have enclined to the Reformation, was persuaded by the
  learned Vatablus (professor of the Hebrew tongue in the University of
  Paris) to exercise his poetical phancies in translating some of David's
  Psalms. For whose satisfaction, and his own, he translated the first
  fifty of them; and, after flying to Geneva, grew acquainted with Beza,
  who in some tract of time translated the other hundred also, and caused
  them to be fitted unto several times; which hereupon began to be sung in
  private houses, and by degrees to be taken up in all the churches of the
  French, and other nations which followed the Genevian platform. Marot's
  translation is said by Strada to have been ignorantly and perversely
  done, as being but the work of a man altogether unlearned; but not to be
  compared with that barbarity and botching, which everywhere occurreth in
  the translation of Sternhold and Hopkins. Which notwithstanding being
  first allowed for private devotion, they were by little and little
  brought into the use of the church, <i>permitted rather than allowed</i>
  to be sung before and after sermons; afterwards printed and bound up with
  the Common Prayer Book, and at last added by the stationers at the end of
  the Bible. For, though it is expressed in the title of those singing
  psalms, that they were set forth and allowed to be sung in all churches
  before and after Morning and Evening Prayer, and also before and after
  sermons; yet this allowance seems rather to have been a <i>connivance</i>
  than an <i>approbation</i>: no such allowance being anywhere found by
  such as have been most industrious and concerned in the search thereof.
  At first it was pretended only that the said Psalms should be sung before
  and after Morning and Evening Prayer, and also before and after sermons;
  which shows they were not to be intermingled in the public Liturgie. But
  in some tract of time, as the Puritan faction grew in strength and <!--
  Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page461"></a>{461}</span>
  confidence, they prevailed so far in most places, to thrust the <i>Te
  Deum</i>, the <i>Benedictus</i>, the <i>Magnificat</i>, and the <i>Nunc
  Dimittis</i>, quite out of the church. But of this more perhaps
  hereafter, when we shall come to the discovery of the Puritan practices
  in the times succeeding."</p>

<h3>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IN THE GREEK CHURCH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 380.)</p>

  <p>The cross, X, in the Greek Church, represents the initial of <span
  title="Christos" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>, the Messiah, the
  symbolic affixing of which (sealing) before and after baptism indicates
  that the name of Christ is imposed on the believer, who takes his new or
  Christian name at baptism. This mark on the forehead refers to Revelation
  vii. 3., xiv. 1., xxii. 4. The longer catechism of that church, in answer
  to the question, "What force has the sign of the cross, used on this and
  other occasions?" says, "What the <i>name</i> of Jesus Christ crucified
  is, when pronounced with faith by the motion of the lips, the <i>very
  same</i> is also the sign of the cross, when made with faith by <i>the
  motion of the hand</i>, or represented in any other way." The authority
  quoted is Cyril of Jerusalem (<i>Cat. Lect.</i> xiii. 36.).</p>

  <p>In the Western Church the cross, <img src="images/017.png" width="11"
  height="16" alt="Latin cross" />, represented the <span title="stauros" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span> whereon Christ
  suffered.</p>

  <p>Both these crosses are now found in the Greek Church; and the Latin
  form, <img src="images/017.png" width="11" height="16" alt="Latin cross"
  />, has at least been used therein nine centuries, for in Goar's
  <i>Rituale Græcorum</i> may be seen (pp. 114, 115. 126.) the icons of
  Saints Methodius, Germanus, and Cyrillus, whose vestments are embellished
  with Latin crosses. The Latin cross is marked on the sacramental bread of
  the Greek communion,&mdash;which bread is also impressed with an
  abbreviation of the words on Constantine's labarum: "Jesus Christ
  overcometh." (Eusebius's <i>Life of Constantine</i>, lib. i. c. 25.:
  compare with Goar's <i>Rituale Græcorum</i>, p. 117.)</p>

  <p>The Latin cross, <img src="images/017.png" width="11" height="16"
  alt="Latin cross" />, is rarely found on the sepulchres in the catacombs
  at Rome,&mdash;the most ancient Christian memorials; but, instead of it,
  a combination of the letters <span class="grk">&Chi;</span><span
  class="grk">&Rho;</span> prevails, as the monogram for "Christ." Aringhi,
  in his <i>Roma Subterranea</i> (Romæ, 1651) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Illud autem fatendum nobis est, nullatenus ante felicissima
  Constantini Magni ad fidem traducti tempora crucem publicæ populorum
  venerationi expositam fuisse."&mdash;Vol. ii. lib. vi. c. xiv. p.
  546.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following statement from Humphrey's <i>Montfaucon</i> (vol. x.
  part ii. book iii. cap. 1. p. 158.) is very clear as to the form of the
  cross:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The cross, made with beams put together, had the shape of the
  Samaritan <i>tau</i>, says St. Jerome, whose words are these: 'In the
  oldest <i>Hebrew</i> letters, which the Samaritans now make use of, the
  last, which is <i>tau</i>, had the form of a cross.' This <i>tau</i>,
  like a cross, was like the <span class="grk">&Tau;</span> of the Greeks,
  according to Paulinus, who says that the shape of the cross is expressed
  by the Greek letter <i>tau</i>, which stands for three hundred. The cross
  of our Lord was something different from the letter <i>tau</i>; the beam
  that was fixed in the earth crossing that which was athwart it above, and
  made as it were a head by rising above it: such a cross we see in the
  medals of Constantine the Great, in this form, <img src="images/017.png"
  width="11" height="16" alt="Latin cross" />, and such is it found
  described in the most ancient Christian monuments; this is the form of
  the cross which St. Jerome means, when he compares it to birds flying, to
  a man swimming, and to a man praying to God, with his arms extended."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Greek church has retained <i>both</i> forms: the Latin Church, in
  its ignorance of the Greek language, has lost the more important symbol.
  These forms were probably invented by Constantine, who used them on his
  helmet, as crests were afterwards used in the ages of chivalry.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. J. Buckton</span>.

  <p class="address">Birmingham.

  <p>The difference between the manner in which the members of the Greek
  and those of the Latin Church used to sign themselves with the sign of
  the cross is this: both used the right hand, the thumb and first and
  second fingers open, and the third and fourth closed; both began at the
  forehead, and descended to the breast: but in crossing that vertical line
  by an horizontal one, from one shoulder to the other, the <i>Greeks go
  from the right to the left</i>, but the <i>Latins from the left to the
  right</i>. It is said, that in the Latin Church, up to the thirteenth
  century, the cross line was traced indifferently from either
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Whilst there is this difference between the Greek and Latin sign of
  the cross when made upon oneself, there is also a difference between the
  two when made upon others. The Latin <i>Benediction</i> is given with the
  thumb and the first two fingers open; the third and fourth fingers
  remaining closed. This arrangement of the the fingers is symbolical of
  the Trinity: the three open fingers signifying the three divine persons,
  and the two closed fingers being emblematic of the two natures of
  Christ.</p>

  <p>The Greek benediction is given with the forefinger entirely open; the
  middle finger slightly bent, the thumb crossed upon the third finger, and
  the little finger bent.</p>

  <p>In the present day, however, in the Latin Church, a person making on
  himself the sign of the cross, employs the right hand entirely open,
  instead of three fingers only. And as it has been thought desirable to
  make a distinction between the benediction given by a bishop and a
  priest, bishops reserved to themselves the right of blessing with three
  fingers; and priests give the benediction with the hand entirely open.
  <!-- Page 462 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>J. C. B. will find this subject fully treated in Didron's <i>Christian
  Iconography</i>, Bohn's edition, pp. 405. 412.; and an illustration of
  the Latin benediction at p. 205., and the Greek benediction at p.
  176.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  "N. &amp; Q." of March 12 as "being simple, inexpensive, and keeping good
  a length of time." In accordance with what I then stated, I herewith give
  the readers of "N. &amp; Q." the benefit of it, and leave them to form
  their own opinion of its value after trying it:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Protosulphate of iron &mdash; 12 grs.</p>
      <p>Nitrate of lead &mdash; 8 grs.</p>

      <p>Acetic acid &mdash; ½ dr.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Dissolve the protosulphate of iron in the water; then throw in the
  nitrate of lead in powder; stir with glass rod until it is dissolved;
  keep stirring while pouring in the acetic acid, and for a few minutes
  afterwards. Let the precipitate subside, then filter. I have used nothing
  else for positives on glass since I discovered the preparation. I have
  not tried it for developing in the wax-paper or other paper process. The
  liquid is colourless as water when first made. By long keeping it will
  change colour, but throws down no deposit, nor loses its properties. If
  those gentlemen who try it would give their opinions of it, I should be
  obliged.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Wilkinson's simple mode of levelling Cameras.</i>&mdash;The
  following ingenious suggestion appears in the 3rd Number of the
  <i>Journal of the Photographic Society</i>, and deserves to be widely
  circulated. "My plan is to place a T-square on the bottom of the camera,
  and draw one perpendicular line on each side (exactly opposite to each
  other), either with paint or pencil; or the ends of the camera itself
  will do if perpendicular to the base. Then, having two musket bullets
  attached to a silk thread, simply hang them over the camera, and
  everything required will be attained much quicker by these plumb-lines,
  and with accuracy equal to the spirit-levels. The advantage of the simple
  contrivance of two bullets suspended by threads is, that when the thread
  is laid across the camera, it is at once seen whether the thread touches
  all the way down both sides; if not, one or other side of the camera is
  raised, until the thread lies close on each side: this gives the level
  crossways. The other perpendicular of the line is then sought for, and
  the back or front of the camera raised or lowered, until the thread cuts
  the line drawn below. Here then we have the most perfect line that can be
  obtained, at the expense of two bullets and a bit of silk, answering
  every purpose of the best spirit-level, and applied in one-half the time.
  It has since occurred to me, that as we sometimes require to measure the
  distance for stereoscopic pictures, this thread ought to be about three
  feet long; and we might as well make three knots, and then we should have
  the measure of a three-feet rule always with us. It has also occurred to
  me, that in taking portraits you sometimes require to have a measure of
  time; and by a little modification we have here the most accurate
  chronometer that can be produced. Instead of three feet, I make it
  thirty-nine inches and the decimal necessary, say two-tenths from the
  centre of support to the centre of the bullet. I then get a pendulum
  which vibrates to second exactly, from the point of suspension to the
  point of oscillation. I hang it by a pin, and I there have a chronometer
  of the greatest possible accuracy; and I can employ it for taking
  portraits of one, two, three, or four seconds: it will vibrate for a
  minute. Consequently I have a mode of levelling my camera with the
  greatest accuracy, a measure of time, and a measure of distance; and all
  at a cost considerably under one penny."</p>

  <p><i>Antiquarian Photographic Club.</i>&mdash;This association for the
  interchange of photographic views of objects of antiquarian interest, has
  now nearly attained the number of members to which it is proposed to
  limit it. For the few remaining vacancies preference will be given, for
  obvious reasons, to parties resident in varied localities. Any gentlemen
  or ladies desirous to join the club, may send their names, with specimens
  of their skill, to the <i>Honorary Secretary</i>, care of Mr. Bell, 186.
  Fleet Street. The amount of the annual subscription is not yet fixed, but
  as all that can be required will be to meet the expenses incident to the
  receipt and interchange of the photographs, it must necessarily be very
  limited.</p>

  following quotation from the <i>Agricultural Gazette</i>, March 4, 1848,
  p. 166.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Mangold wurzel is simply the German of <i>beet-root</i>. 'Mangel
  wurzel,' on the other hand, is one founded on an idea, which, though
  absurd, did not the less effectually answer the object of those who
  introduced the plant. 'Scarcity root,' or 'Famine root,' made a good
  heading to an advertisement."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Rham, <i>Dictionary of the Farm</i>, p. 62.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The German name is 'Mangold wurzel,' or 'Mangold root;' but it is
  sometimes pronounced 'Mangel wurzel,' which means <i>scarcity root</i>;
  and, by a strange translation, it is called in French <i>racine
  d'abondance</i>, as well as <i>racine de disette</i>. The name of
  field-beet is much more appropriate."</p>

  <p>I hope E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R. will, however, not insist on classing those who say
  and write "mangold" with those who would write "reddishes, sparrowgrass,

  <p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. vi., p. 432. &amp;c.; Vol. vii., p.
  392.).&mdash;<i>Totnes</i> may be added to the list of places containing
  parochial libraries. The books are placed in presses in the vestry room
  of the church, and so preserved from loss and damage to which they were
  formerly subjected. The collection is principally composed of works of
  divinity published in the seventeenth century, the age of profound
  theological literature. I noticed amongst the goodly array of weighty
  folios, the works of St. Augustine, the <i>Homilies</i> of St.
  Chrysostom, works of St. Ambrose, St. Gregory, &amp;c., the works of the
  high and mighty King James, Birckbek's <i>Protestant Evidence</i>, and
  Walton's <i>Polyglott</i>. Nothing is known of the history and formation
  of this library. Inside the cover of one of the volumes is the following
  inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Totnes Library. The guift of Mr. Thomas Southcott, July 10.
  1656."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I found the following incorrect and antiquated piece of information
  respecting this library in a flimsy work, published in 1850, entitled,
  <i>A Graphic and Historical Sketch of the Antiquities of Totnes</i>, by
  William Cotton, F.S.A., <i>note</i>, p. 38.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I know not what the library contains. I believe nothing more than
  theological lumber. It is always locked up, and made no use of by those
  who keep it, and it is inaccessible to those who would wish to examine
  it. I was once there by accident, and looked into some books, which were
  all on Divinity."</p>

  <p><i>Judge Smith</i> (Vol. vii., p. 13.).&mdash;Judge Smith lived
  towards the close of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and was noted for severity
  against witches. His monument is in Chesterfield Church. He belonged to
  the ancient family seated at Dunston Hall, near that town, which I
  believe has lately ended in co-heiresses. The late Sir J.&nbsp;E. Smith was of
  the same family: his father, a considerable merchant of Norwich, married
  a Kindersley descended from Geoffrey,&mdash;who was queried in Vol. vi.,
  p. 603., and is ancestor of the present Vice-Chancellor.</p>

  <p><i>Charade attributed to Sheridan</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  379.).&mdash;Several years ago, I think in 1818 or 1819, a friend gave me
  some verses nearly similar to those communicated by your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Balliolensis</span>, and requested me to ascertain if
  they were Mrs. Piozzi's, as my friend had been told that they were
  written by that lady. Soon afterwards I asked Mrs. Piozzi if she ever
  wrote a riddle on a gaming-table. She replied, "Yes, a very long time
  ago." She immediately repeated a line or two, and, after some
  consideration, recited the following, which, she assured me, were her
  original composition. These lines, it will be observed, differ somewhat
  from those attributed to Sheridan, but they were probably the basis of
  those, and also of other versions of the riddle, which, I believe, are in
  existence. This statement so thoroughly removes all uncertainty about the

  <p><i>Gesmas and Desmas</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 238. 342.).&mdash;The names
  of the two thieves crucified with our blessed Saviour are variously
  written. In the verses quoted by A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. (p. 238.) they are written
  <i>Gesmas and Desmas</i>. In the edition of the Gospel of Nicodemus,
  quoted by W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;H. (p. 342.), <i>i.e.</i> the edition of "William Hone,
  Ludgate Hill, 1820," the names are written <i>Gestas and Dimas</i>. He
  also gives an authority for the spelling "<i>Dismas and Gestas</i>." I
  find them written in the edition I have of the Gospel of Nicodemus,
  <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Hutman's, London, 1818," <i>Dismas and Gesmas</i> (pp. 87,
  88.). Elsewhere I have met with them written as in the following verse,
  <i>Gistas and Dismas</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gistas damnatur, Dismas ad astra levatur,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which I have ventured to translate:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gistas to hell&mdash;with Dismas all goes well;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or perhaps better thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gistas goes down, Dismas receives a crown."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The names of these two men in early life is said to have been
  <i>Titus</i> and <i>Dumachus</i>: see the <i>Evangelium Infantiæ</i>,

  <p><i>Lode</i> (Vol. v., pp. 345. 350.).&mdash;There is in Gloucester a
  church and parish called Saint Mary de Lode, touching which Mr. Fosbroke
  (<i>History of City of Gloucester</i>, p. 341.) observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This parish is said to have derived the adjunct of <i>Lode</i> from
  the Severn formerly running near it; and this may have been the fact, but
  it is not easy to give a satisfactory explanation of the term."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I would remark, that as the term <i>Lode</i> may be considered a
  general name for any navigable river, that if it be a fact that the river
  Severn did formerly run near the parish in question, it appears to me not
  difficult to give a satisfactory explanation of the term by which such
  parish is distinguished from St. Mary de Crypt and St. Mary de Grace.</p>

  <p><i>Epitaphs imprecatory</i> (Vol. vii., p. 256).&mdash;I have no doubt
  that the churchyards of Scotland will furnish many examples of the
  embittered feelings which religious persecution produced, during the
  latter half of the seventeenth century; and as a specimen I forward the
  following, which is found in the churchyard of Dalgarnock, in
  Dumfriesshire. The Duke of York alluded to was afterwards James II.; and
  the descendants of Mr. Harkness are still most respectable inhabitants of
  the parish of Closeburn, which has been united to Dalgarnock:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

      <p>With Christ his Glorious King.</p>
      <p>And swear allegence to that beast,</p>

  <p>The following may be given as an example of a punning epitaph. It is
  found in St. Anne's churchyard, in the Isle of Man, and is said to have
  been written by Sir Wadsworth Busk, who was for many years
  attorney-general of the island:</p>

  <p><i>Straw-bail</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 85. 342.).&mdash;The origin of the
  expression "a man of straw" may be traced to those mannikins or effigies
  representing the human figure, which are (or used to be) paraded in the
  streets during the Carnival in most continental countries. These
  mannikins were <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page465"></a>{465}</span> generally stuffed with <i>straw</i>; and
  hence, in legal phraseology, "a man of straw" denotes the semblance of a
  man&mdash;a person of neither substance nor responsibility, who is put
  forward to screen a real delinquent, or bear the brunt of a prosecution.
  Such, at least, is the origin commonly assigned by the French to their
  "homme de paille," the prototype of our "man of straw."</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The anniversary of the Camden Society on Monday last, when Mr. Peter
  Cunningham, Sir F. Madden, and Sir C. Young were elected on the Council,
  was distinguished by two departures from the usual routine: one, a
  special vote of thanks to Sir Harry Verney for placing his family papers
  at the service of the Society; and the other, a general expression of
  satisfaction on the part of the members at the steps taken by the Council
  to bring under the consideration of the Commission appointed to inquire
  into the laws regarding matters testamentary, the great impediments
  thrown in the way of all historical and literary inquirers by the
  authorities in the Prerogative Office.</p>

  <p>It does not require the skill of an &OElig;dipus to divine that in
  giving us so graphic a picture of <i>The Vicar and his Duties</i>, the
  Rev. A. Gatty has had the advantage of sketching from the life, and that
  his portraiture of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"A good man of religioun</p>

  <p>is as much a true effigy, though taken with pen and ink, as if he had
  put that capital parish priest, the Vicar of Leeds, before his camera. To
  the many friends of Dr. Hook, this little volume will be deeply

  <i>Etymological Compendium, or Portfolio of Origins and Inventions. Third
  Edition, revised and improved, by</i> Merton A. Thoms. This new edition
  of a very popular and useful little book has had the advantage of a
  thorough revision, and contains much new and interesting
  information.&mdash;Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i> has lately been
  enriched by two of Mr. Macaulay's brilliant essays, viz. on <i>Lord
  Byron</i> and <i>The Comic Dramatists of the Restoration</i>, and by a
  carefully compiled life of <i>Marshal Turenne</i> by the Rev. T.&nbsp;O.
  Cockayne: while Mr. Murray has added to his valuable collection of
  <i>Railway Readings</i>, a reprint of <i>The Life of Lord Bacon</i>, by
  his noble biographer Lord Campbell.&mdash;<i>Reynard the Fox, after the
  German Version of Göthe, with Illustrations by</i> J. Wolf. Part V. This
  translation is kept up with spirit, and the present number carries us to
  <i>The Pardon</i> of the wily transgressor.&mdash;Mr. Bohn has put forth
  numerous fresh claims on the favour of poor scholars: in his <i>Standard
  Library</i> he has given a third volume of <i>Miss Bremer's Works</i>,
  containing <i>Home</i> and <i>Strife and Peace</i>; in his <i>Classical
  Library</i> he continues the translation of <i>Aristotle</i> in <i>The
  Politics and Economics</i>, translated by G. Walford, M.A.; in his
  <i>Antiquarian Library</i>, he has continued in his series of
  translations of Early English Chronicles by giving us in one volume a
  translation of <i>Henry of Huntingdon</i>, and also of the <i>Gesta
  Stephani</i>; while he will have done good service to naturalists and
  keepers of aviaries and cage birds by the edition of Bechstein's <i>Cage
  and Chamber Birds</i> and Sweet's <i>Warblers</i>, which he has included
  in the same volume of his <i>Illustrated Library</i>.</p>

  <p><b>GOETHE'S FAUST</b>: With Copious English Notes, Grammatical,
  Philological, and Exegetical, for Students of the German Language. By
  FALK LEBAHN, Ph.D., Author of "German in One Volume," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"Not an idle addition to the many various impressions already existing
  in our literature of Goethe's masterpiece, but an edition prepared for
  the use of those students of German who read without a master. First we
  have the original text complete. Then the grammatical note, which occupy
  the place of a vocabulary, repeat the whole of the text in both German
  and English, classified according to Doctor Lebahn's system, and with
  reciprocal references to the pages and rules of grammar. The plan is
  highly ingenious, and we may add that the numberous extracts from other
  German authors, which illustrate the meanings of Goethe, will be often
  found very curious and interesting."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
